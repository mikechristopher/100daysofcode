So today has been mainly made up of making small amendments to this blog so as to make it look a bit nicer going forward if anyone else decides to take a look and read through.

#### ***What have I completed today*** :white_check_mark:

- Removed default post - this keeps the nice listing of the dates in order to show day by day.
- Updated CSS on post page - Taken away from default and instead of having white bg colour its now matching the rest of the site.  This was primarily down to the way it was looking for the CSS and not looking at the root directory.
- Fixed footer on main page - This now again flows through from main page, keeping contact and social links.

#### ***What is next on the list*** :pencil2:

- Freecodecamp update - need to catch up with some more of the JS sections on FCC.  I have also got some Udemy videos to take a look at and follow along with.
- GH Pages CSS - Further styling on the posts pages and tidy up of home page.  On the main page there is something certainly missing.  Need to figure out a nicer way of breaking those posts up.  One the posts page its looking much better now but all up for making it look a bit tidier.

#### ***What have I been reading?*** :books:

- Markdown formatting guides - This is becoming key seeing as each daily post is in MD format and therefore to make things nice and quick when writing posts its useful to know the various formatting functionality thats easily available.
