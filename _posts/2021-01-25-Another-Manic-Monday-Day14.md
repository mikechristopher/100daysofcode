So another manic Monday - seems like a theme with work at the moment! I schedule out at least 1 hour a day to focus on my own development however certain days seem a lot harder than others to actually step away.  With that I still managed a little bit of FCC today and got a few more modules done.  I have also started work over the weekend on a simple quote generator just to get into the swing of including JS into my code.

#### ***What have I completed today*** :white_check_mark:

- ES6 - FCC Modules

#### ***What is next on the list*** :pencil2:

- Finish FCC ES6

#### ***What have I been reading / watching?*** :books: :tv:

- Nothing as of yet but I am sure there will be more over the course of the evening :)
