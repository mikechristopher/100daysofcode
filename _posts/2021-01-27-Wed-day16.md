A couple more modules done today on ES6 - still working my way through - am on to Classes now.  Whilst I have classed all this as 100 days of code - I think its more leading my way to 100 days of code as whilst yes I am doing bits of coding whilst learning its not officially creating anything as of yet.  I have a number of projects I want to get started on however want to ensure I have the knowledge there rather than needing to stop / start as I go.  It is enjoyable and learning so much at the moment!

#### ***What have I completed today*** :white_check_mark:

#### ***What have I been reading / watching?*** :books: :tv:

- JAMStack - Been reading a lot into this in trying to understand it further and the possibilities of it.
