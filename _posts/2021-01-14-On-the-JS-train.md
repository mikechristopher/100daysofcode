#### ***What have I completed today*** :white_check_mark:

- More watching less action today.  I have been making some notes and researching various ideas for putting together my own little project of which I feel would find useful in order to almagamate all of the resources I am building whilst researching free dev resources.  Whilst I am sure there are many lists out there that detail free resources I want to build my own list.

#### ***What is next on the list*** :pencil2:

- FCC JS

#### ***What have I been reading / watching?*** :books: :tv:

- Youtube recording of JS live coding challenge - Focusing on HTML / CSS / JS - Getting a total, average, most, least values of an array.  This was an extensive piece over the course of 3 hours - whilst it would have been better to watch and do it in tandem with them as they were creating it - it gave a very useful insight into some of the functionality within JS and how easy it was to implement.  Much easier it felt that reading through / practicing on FCC. This followed on with another video of which talked about a Bug Tracker challenge of which talked about JQuery dashboards, Auth0, Azure and Bootstrap so again a very good insight into the different products.  I have used Bootstrap before and taken a look at Azure but certainly interesting around Auth0 and JQuery functionality.
