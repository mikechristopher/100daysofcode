Good progress made today completing about 30% of the remaining basic JS module on FCC. Learnt a hell of a lot in doing it and struggled in some areas but then surprised myself in some places in getting the answers straight off.  Its going to be a long learning curve as I start to use JS more and more but its something I have been wanting to do for ages but always struggled to get my head around it.  So the more I learn from it the better.  

The one area I found a little bit of a struggle was on the Record Collection Challenge.  You had to update JSON entries using checks against arrays and values etc.  This ended up being the final code (JSON not included).

```javascript
function updateRecords(object, id, prop, value) {
    //Check if property in value isnt tracks and value is not empty then update the prop from value given
  if (prop !== 'tracks' && value !== "") {
    object[id][prop] = value;
    //Check if prop in value is tracks but album does not have a tracks property then create empty array and add value to it
  } else if (prop === "tracks" && !object[id].hasOwnProperty("tracks")) {
    object[id][prop] = [value];
    //Check if prop is tracks and value existing is not blank - therefore push new value to the end of the row
  } else if (prop === "tracks" && value !== "") {
    object[id][prop].push(value);
    //Check if value given is empty - therefore delete existing object from prop
  } else if (value === "") {
    delete object[id][prop];
  }
  return object;
}
```
