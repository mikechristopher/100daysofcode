Good progress made today completing about 30% of the remaining basic JS module on FCC. Learnt a hell of a lot in doing it and struggled in some areas but then surprised myself in some places in getting the answers straight off.  Its going to be a long learning curve as I start to use JS more and more but its something I have been wanting to do for ages but always struggled to get my head around it.  So the more I learn from it the better.
