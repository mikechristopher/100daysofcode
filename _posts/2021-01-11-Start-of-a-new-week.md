So the start of a new week and coincidentally it also happens to be my birthday today.  So celebrating it working as just another yearly milestone to pass :)

#### ***What have I completed today*** :white_check_mark:

- Refactored CSS - went through whole CSS file removing what was overflow from original site and therefore unused here - Need to add to the list to refactor main site to removed any unused from there.
- Tried to modify the index page in order to display posts by month but failed so took a rolling back and time to reinvestigate the issue.

#### ***What is next on the list*** :pencil2:

- Freecodecamp - Need to get back on for some more JS training
- Main blog roll CSS - On the main page there is something certainly missing and needs some focus.  Need to figure out a nicer way of breaking those posts up by month or something like that.  Need to take a look at other jekyll sites and see how they doing it and go from there.

#### ***What have I been reading / watching?*** :books: :tv:

- Twitch live stream on Vue.js development
- Twitch live stream on FCC JS Tutorials - Arrays
