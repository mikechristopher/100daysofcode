#### ***What have I completed today*** :white_check_mark:

- Absolutely nothing!  Poor day of updates today due to it being manic so cannot really include this as day 9!  Will hopefully update more later this evening but so far - work has taken over!

#### ***What is next on the list*** :pencil2:

- FCC JS

#### ***What have I been reading / watching?*** :books: :tv:

- Spent hours reading up on Tailwind CSS and looks like it is certainly the route I want to undertake over Bootstrap.  The one thing I found with bootstrap is that every thing felt very sameish everywhere you went.  What I like about the look of tailwind is how extensible it is - especially with things like colour schemes etc. So the next project - will be looking to use that.
