This morning was certainly more productive.  I managed to get done what I wanted to on here in sorting out the index page.  I do want to tidy things up a bit more certainly but have spent enough time getting this thing working rather than learning - In saying that I have learnt more about github and markdown along the way so not all time spent is lost.  Next focus is back on JS.  I have been watching quite a bit on twitch in the background whilst working so taking some of it as I go but very little JS streams about so will look to youtube I think tomorrow in order to have some of them playing in the background instead.  Even if I only take in little bits its key to have something there in the background to soak in instead of just music.

#### ***What have I completed today*** :white_check_mark:

- Fixed year on posts - forgot we had moved to 2021 and had categorised all posts as 2020
- Added breakdown on index by month/year

#### ***What is next on the list*** :pencil2:

- Freecodecamp - Need to get back on for some more JS training
- Main blog roll CSS - Now that have added the monthly breakdown - one on the backburner but still something that needs to be revisited.  It does however look much better

#### ***What have I been reading / watching?*** :books: :tv:

- Twitch live stream on Vue JS Dev
- Twitch live stream on Twitch OBS Plugin Dev
- Twitch live stream on C# CodeAcademy learning
- Jekyll documentation / Liquid in order to understand the functions behind the index page.
