Today I slacked.  Real world caught up on me as did work so did not get a chance to get anything done.  Will make up for it tomorrow.

#### ***What have I completed today*** :white_check_mark:

- Nothing :(

#### ***What is next on the list*** :pencil2:

- Freecodecamp - Need to get back on for some more JS training
- Main blog roll CSS - On the main page there is something certainly missing and needs some focus.  Need to figure out a nicer way of breaking those posts up by month or something like that.  Need to take a look at other jekyll sites and see how they doing it and go from there.

#### ***What have I been reading / watching?*** :books: :tv:

- Twitch live stream on Docker development / discussions
- Twitch live stream on FCC JS Tutorials - ES6
