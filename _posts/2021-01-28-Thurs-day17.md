This was a busy day for me! I worked end to end on a quote generator - whilst it was basic it was a good learning curve for me to finally put in some proper work on Javascript of which I have never really done bar the FCC and grasshopper learning modules.  It was actually putting it in to practice and boy did I learn something along the way.

You can see the final product here: <https://github.com/mikechristopher/Quote-Gen>

There will be some more work on this over time but I hit the first level of achievements I wanted to make on it.
