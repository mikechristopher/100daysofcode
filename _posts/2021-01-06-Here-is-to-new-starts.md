So I finally got back around to starting off my coding track again this new year.  Going back to basics again focusing on front end - HTML, CSS and Javascript.  I could never get my head around JS the first time around but I really want to try and get through it this time.  I had got half way through the freecodecamp JS section previously but have gone back and started it again and aim to complete a few modules each day at least.

I have a number of projects that I wish to work on but I need to walk before I run along.  Whilst yes I could look at taking sections of code from frameworks left right and center I think the key is being able to understand it first before utilising these frameworks.  No point knowing how it works before using it.

So this is my accountability - a post each day for the next 100 days (excluding weekends probably where as I will focus on reading rather than coding) but will account for what I have done when I update.

If anyone actually reads this - then enjoy! :)

My hour spent today has focused around getting this Jekyll blog roll up and running alongside my gh-pages set up.  I also refactored the CSS in order to fit in with the same look and feel of the seperate HTML front end.  There is still tons of work to get done but its where we are for today.  Same time tomorrow.
