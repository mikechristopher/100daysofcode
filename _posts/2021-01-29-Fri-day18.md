Finished on final tweaks and committed the quote gen to Github that I was working on yesterday.  I also have been watching some videos and reading articles on the whole Jamstack processes again following on from Wednesday.  I find it intruiging on how much can be achieved with having no "real" backend as such and having a fully blown website using HTML/CSS/JS incorporating API's etc.  I have been using Markdown for a bit now to publish these entries through Jekyll but Eleventy certainly intruiges me a bit more in wanting to bring the whole portfolio site under one umbrella - doing a whole new redesign using some sort of system like this and some Tailwind - making it pretty but functionable too.  However that will be a whole new project down the line!
