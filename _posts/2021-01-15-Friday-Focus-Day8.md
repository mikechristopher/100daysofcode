#### ***What have I completed today*** :white_check_mark:

- Spent time working on HTML/Bootstrap CSS template of which I want to use for new project.  Getting to grips on the different classes available to save time in writing it all out by hand and relying on using the Bootstrap framework instead.  I have a good knowledge of CSS but looking at frameworks for small projects in order to speed things up - will be the same for JS as seen a number of JQuery and Bootstrap additions there which are useful - however not taking away from the fact that I need to know the language at the same time.

#### ***What is next on the list*** :pencil2:

- FCC JS

#### ***What have I been reading / watching?*** :books: :tv:

- Bootstrap documentation
- Changes between v4 and v5 of Bootstrap
