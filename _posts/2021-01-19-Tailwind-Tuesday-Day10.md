I wouldn't say I have completed a lot today however have been having a good play around with various JS things - have installed Gatsby and Tailwind to see if I can get a working site up using that and converting what I had started on with my project using Bootstrap over to using Tailwind instead.  Wanting to see if I can get the hang of using all of the various tools to hand.

#### ***What have I completed today*** :white_check_mark:

- Installed NPM
- Installed Gatsby
- Installed Tailwind
- Installed Tailwind Playground

#### ***What is next on the list*** :pencil2:

- FCC JS
- Further investigation into using Gatsby as a platform going forward as well as incorporating Tailwind CSS.

#### ***What have I been reading / watching?*** :books: :tv:

- Spent more hours reading up on Tailwind CSS and ways of using it - either with Vanilla JS, Gatsby, React, Vue etc.  Think I need more work on using JS first before dredging too much into JS frameworks.
